# MIS-443 SQL Project - Foodie-Fi

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **MIS-443 SQL Challenge**, where we analyze real-world datasets using SQL. We have chosen **Case Study #3: Foodie-Fi**, which focuses on subscription-based business analysis.

**Foodie-Fi** is a streaming service for food-related content, similar to Netflix but for food lovers. Our goal is to explore customer subscription behavior, pricing plans, and business trends using SQL queries.

## Objectives
- Understand customer subscription patterns and plan transitions.
- Analyze revenue trends from different subscription types.
- Identify key business insights using SQL queries.

## Project Structure
- `queries.sql` â†’ Contains all SQL queries used in the analysis.
- `insights.md` â†’ Explains key insights derived from the queries.
- `foodie-fi_presentation.pdf` â†’ A summary presentation of findings.
- `README.md` â†’ This project documentation.

## Dataset Overview
The **Foodie-Fi** dataset consists of:
- `plans` â†’ Subscription plan details.
- `subscriptions` â†’ Customer subscription records.

For more details, visit the [original case study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/).

- What are the most **popular subscription plans**?
- How much **revenue** does Foodie-Fi generate monthly?
- What is the **average subscription duration** per plan?
- Are there seasonal trends in **customer sign-ups**?
